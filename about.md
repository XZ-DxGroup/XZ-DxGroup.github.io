**Hi we are a new International Dx Group**.

The idea of creating this group was born from a great desire to make radio and to meet new people in the amateur radio field.
The main founders are from the internet,none really know each other,we just are ham radio enthusiast that like share knoledge with others that do so.
These are the ones who helped and created things that helped XZ Group to grow up faster,for example the making of the site,the making of the  QSL or just the making of the discord server... :
