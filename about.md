**Hi we are a new International Dx Group**.

The idea of creating this group was born from a great desire to make radio and to meet new people in the amateur radio field.
The main founders are from the internet, none really know each other, we just are ham radio enthusiast that likes to share knowledge with others that also likes to do so.

We have many projects on our minds that will see the daylight in the next future, so stay connected for updates!


These are the ones who helped and created things that helped XZ Group to grow up faster, for example the making of the site, the making of the  QSL or just the making of the discord server... :
